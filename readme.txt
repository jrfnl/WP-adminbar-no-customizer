Moves the Customizer link from the Adminbar top level to be a subitem under the site-menu.

== Description ==

Tiny plugin which moves the Customizer link which is shown on the front-end since WP 4.3 from the top-level of the admin bar to be a sub-item under the site menu. That's all ;-)

Rationale: For most websites, the "Customizer" link is only useful during the initial setup phase of the website. After that it just takes up Admin bar real estate. What with so many other plugins now adding things to the admin bar, that space can be used more effectively by other things.

To still keep the customizer quickly accessible, the item is moved rather than *re*moved.
